xbacklight
How to adjust screen brightness on Manjaro 

Brightness can be set using the xorg-xbacklight package.
Note:
    xbacklight currently does not work with the modesetting driver [3].

To set brightness to 50% of maximum:

$ xbacklight -set 50

Increments can be used instead of absolute values, for example to increase or decrease brightness by 10%:

$ xbacklight -inc 10
$ xbacklight -dec 10
